# code-explain-viz

**Short:** `code-explain-viz` explains functions, generates step-by-step reasoning, creates a Mermaid flowchart of control flow, and suggests unit tests — combining LLM-generated explanations with deterministic AST-based visualizations.

## Quick start

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run CLI demo:
```bash
python cli.py --file data_examples/example_code.py
```

3. Copy the Mermaid flowchart text printed by CLI into a Mermaid live editor (https://mermaid.live) or render with mermaid-cli to see the visual flowchart.

## What you get
- `short` one-line explanation
- `detailed` explanation (multi-line)
- `mermaid` flowchart text describing control flow
- `unit_tests` template (pytest)

## How it works
- A sequence-to-sequence model (CodeT5) generates natural language explanations from code.
- `viz_generator.py` parses the function AST and produces a reliable mermaid flowchart.
- Combining both yields both human-friendly narrative and precise structural view.

## Train / Fine-tune
Use `train_docgen.py` with a JSONL dataset (each line: `{"code": "...", "doc": "..."}`).
